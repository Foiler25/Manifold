/// watcher classes and assembles their state into a `CableSnapshot`.
///
/// `snapshot()` starts the watchers once, refreshes the polling-driven ones
/// (the others fire IOKit match notifications during start), and reads.
/// `watch()` keeps them started and polls for changes on a 1s timer.
/// Polling is sufficient because `CablePortWatcher` already requires it for
/// property-change events; the others share the same loop for simplicity.
